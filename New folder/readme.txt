# Project: Simple Web Server & Client

I have used python programming language for this project. Python IDE should be installed for running these programs.

Steps to run the programs:

--> Open the command prompt and go to the directory(use the example command: cd c:/Desktop) where the web_client.py and web_server.py files.
--> By using the command(python3 web_server.py or python3 web_client.py) run the programs on two different terminals, first run the WebServer and then WebClient respectively.
--> Now, open the browser chrome or safari and open the following link "http://localhost:8080/index.html". Here, you can see the contents of the index.html file.
--> Next in the other tab of the browser open the following link "http://localhost:8080/index_dup.html" to check the "404 Error".
